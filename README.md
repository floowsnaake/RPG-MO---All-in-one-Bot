# RPG MO - All in one Bot
So what is? RPG MO - All in one Bot

It is a bot for the game RPG MO that can train skills such as Woodcutting,fishing and Digging sand but i will/im currelty addings more skills all the time and the goal is to add all the skills in the game and make it do things like,auto hunt and kill mobs/AutoFight,Market Bot/sniping,soulve capatchas,being able to run the bot with any browser and not just the client version of the game,running more then 1 bot at the time/multiboxing bot and also making the bot run AFK/so you dont have to have the game open while it is botting.

Prewiew of the bot running:

**Setting up the bot**

So this is what you need to do to be able to run the bot.

First of You need Client version of the game or the steam version not the browser version:

 [Link to Client](http://mo.ee/download.html) Or
 [Link to Steam Client](http://store.steampowered.com/app/372800/)

also you need to Enable some Mods in the game and change some keybinding before you start the bot.
Mods that needs to be ON:

Enhanced Market,Keybinding Extensions,Pet Inventory,Chest Inventory and Miscellaneous Improvements



Keybindings:

`E` Deposit All+ in chest

`X` Unload pet inventory

`C` Load pet inventory

`Q` Toggle inventory

`Z` Withdraw 1 or ALL


Game Options ---> Video:

Smoother Layout = `Off`

Fullscreen = `Off`

`Ctrl` + `Escape` = Exits the bot

So after you have setup everything in the game then there are 2 ways of running the bot,ether you run the RPG MO - All in one Bot.exe or you run the source code with Autohtokey.
(i recommend running the .exe way if you havent used Autohtokey before) 

__Running the script:__
* 1) Download Autohotkey (http://ahkscript.org/download/ahk-install.exe).
* 2) Install Autohotkey 64 or 32 Bits.
* 3) Copy the Code.
* 4) Paste it in to notepad or any other text editor you use-
* 5) Save it as  `RPG MO - All in One Bot.ahk`
* 6) Double click the `RPG MO - All in One Bot.ahk` file
* 7) Now its running, you should see a small icon with a Spade on it in the right corner of the Taskbar/Startbar.
* 8) Now when its running you should see a GUI/ a window on the screen.
* 9) Select what option you want to run/bot. 


So now the bot is running :D
